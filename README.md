# Project 1 - A Number Guessing Game

This project is a console game that users can play. The computer selects a random number between 1 and 100. The user makes guesses as to what that number is. The computer then compares the answer to the number and lets the user know if it's larger or smaller. The user can see their game stats and try and beat their own score!
